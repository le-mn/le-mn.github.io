        <h2>A little more about me</h2>
        
     My full name in Vietnamese is <b>Lê Minh Ngọc</b> (last + middle + first). <br>
    Somehow they don't let me board the airplane so I need to write my first name in the middle, as <b>Minh Ngoc Le</b> (middle + first + last) to get my flight tickets.
    <br>
     Vietnamese people call others by their first names, so feel free to call me _"Ngoc"_ (pronounced: _ŋok_). 
        You can find how to pronounce it <a href="https://forvo.com/user/ngocle0915/">here</a>. <br>
<br>
I know it's hard so I adopted a nickname: <b>"knock"</b> (cute enough)!
