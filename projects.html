                <h3>Globular clusters - dark matter halos relation</h3>
                <p>I am working on my masterâ€™s project with Dr. Andrew Cooper about primordial globular cluster (GC) formation. 
                    The primordial GC formation hypothesis was introduced by Peeble (1984), which states that <b> globular clusters can form inside 
                    their own dark matter halos</b>. To study that, we use the extended Press-Schechter method 
                    (code from Parkinson et al. 2008) and input the modeling conditions of primordial GC formation. 
                    We can reproduce the relationship between the number of GCs and dark matter halo mass, which agrees
                    with observational results on low-mass halos. Some results of this work have already been presented at the IAU 377 Symposium: EARLY DISK-GALAXY FORMATION
FROM JWST TO THE MILKY WAY.

                <h3>Quantifying turbulence in the molecular cloud N55 </h3>
                <p>This summer (from Jun to mid-Aug, 2023), at <b>Leiden Observatory</b> the Netherlands, 
                    I was involved in the <a href="https://leaps.strw.leidenuniv.nl/">Leiden/ESA Astrophysics Program for Summer Students (LEAPS) 2023</a>.
                    With Dr. Piyush Sharda, Dr. Mathilde Bouvier, and Prof. Serena Viti, we quantify turbulence in the molecular cloud N55 in LMC.
                    Within the scope of the 10-week internship, we got the results for turbulence mode in N55, assuming LTE conditions. 
                    We are extending the work for non-LTE conditions (stay tuned for the results)!<br>
