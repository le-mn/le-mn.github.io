           <h2>In my free time</h2>
            <p>- I enjoy <b>singing</b> very much. Besides, I am also a Ukulele beginner (mine named "Erling", which means "twenty" 
        since I brought 'him' home on the last day of 2020, in my 20s-year-old).<br>
        <br> <!-- This line break will have extra space -->

        - As a typical <b>dog person</b>, I love playing with dogs and can spend hours talking to them. 
        Attached is the photo of my certificate for volunteering to take care of dogs on the NTHU campus.
        The dog on the certificate is named Chiao Chiao, she is my favorite one! 
        (I would love to share more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/schrodinger_dogs/">dogs' photos</a>). <br>
        <br> <!-- This line break will have extra space -->

        - I also love writing - the way I "talk to myself" and store my thoughts, experiences, and what I learned from open courses. 
        As any graduate student, I usually face academic problems (stress, loss of motivation, and not knowing how to work/study efficiently). 
        I have been collecting knowledge and experience from senior people to cope with these issues. 
        In the beginning, I just wanted to write things down for myself. However, I felt that may be helpful for other students who are facing the same obstacles as I did. 
        Therefore, I would like to share what I've collected, especially about <b>how to self-motivate under academic pressure</b>, in <a href="https://life-of-a-grad-student.blogspot.com/">Life of a grad student</a>.
