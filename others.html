            <p>- I enjoy singing very much. Besides, I am also a Ukulele beginner (mine named "Erling", which means "twenty" 
        since I brought 'him' home on the last day of 2020, in my 20s-year-old).<br>

        - As a typical dog person, I love playing with dogs and can spend hours talking to them. 
        Attached is the photo of my certificate for volunteering to take care of dogs on the NTHU campus.<br>

        The dog on the certificate is named Chiao Chiao, she is my favorite one! 
        (I would love to share more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/schrodinger_dogs/">dogs' photos</a>). <br>

        - I also love writing - the way I "talk to myself" and store my thoughts, experiences, and what I learned from open courses. 
        As any graduate student, I usually face academic problems (stress, loss of motivation, and not knowing how to work/study efficiently). 
        I have been collecting knowledge and experience from senior people to cope with these issues. 
        In the beginning, I just wanted to write things down for myself. However, I felt that may be helpful for other students who are facing the same obstacles as I did. 
        Therefore, I would like to share what I've collected, especially about how to self-motivate and strengthen mental health under academic pressure, in <a href="https://life-of-a-grad-student.blogspot.com/">Life of a grad student</a>.
